Scenes and levels are used interchangably. One scene for each level. A scene for example a castle, then another for planes and others for menu screens.

To create a new scene go into files -> New Scene, then into Files -> Save Scene.

To add text select the scene, go to GameObject -> UI -> Text.
It adds Canvas, Text, EventSystem.
Under Canvas there is Render mode. Screen Space - Overlay means the canvas will be rendered ontop of everything just before the screen is shown.

When rescaling, use alt to rescale relative to the pivot point.
